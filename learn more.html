        <p>

            Post Independent India we have solved many of our serious problems like<br><br>

            Food shortage by green revolution.<br><br>

            Milk shortage by White revolution.<br><br>

            Reduction in infant mortality and maternal morbidity by improved health care facillites.<br><br>

            Eradicated Small pox and polio by vaccinations.<br><br>

            Improved educational status.<br><br>

            Achieved higher life expectancy (around 68 years).<br><br>

            However we are facing new situation with higher rate than before in certain areas. <br><br>like Over weight,
            Diabetes high BP and Heart attacks . <br><br>Of late cancer related to obesity is on raising trend.
            <br><br>Though we could not solved under nutrition and hygiene related diseases, we are competing with
            Developed countries with Non communicable diseases. <br><br>

            In our urban population above 40 years age persons, one in five is having diabetes or hypertension or
            both along with over weight.<br><br>

            Deaths due to cardiovascular diseases in India increased from 130 laks in 1990 to 280 laks in 2016.
            <br><br>More than half of deaths are due to heart disease. Less than 55years age population are having more heart attacks <br><br>In the
            last 5 years the number of cardiac deaths among age group of less than 40 years increased more than
            27%.<br><br>

            At present people with high BP are around 200 million and expected to increase 214 million by 2025.
            <br><br>Only one out of seven who were diagnosed with High BP is having reasonable control of BP with
            drugs.<br><br>

            Not so sweet news for Indians regarding Diabetes.<br><br>
            India , China and Brazil are in the top nations with high prevalence of diabetes,<br><br>
            In 2015 Indians spent nearly 90.32 billion rupees (9302 crores)on diabetes control alone.<br><br>

            Recent statistics reveal 60% of urban Indians above age 40 years and 20% of children below age 19 years are
            overweight . <br><br>Over weight people are at risk to get High BP, Diabetes ,Heart attacks and
            including 40 % of cancers.<br><br>

            Every one minute 11 million cigarets are smoked all over the world and 10 adults are dying.<br><br>

            Many scientists dedicated their whole life time to solve Obesity, High BP, cancer and heart
            diseases.<br><br>
            Their efforts improved our understanding regarding many chronic non communicable diseases.<br><br>
            Based on their research work guidelines were set up to cope and manage the chronic diseases lie high BP,
            Diabetes and Heart disease.<br><br>

            In spite of best efforts from governmental , Non governmental organisations many young Indians are met with
            premature deaths and causing unbearable economic burdens in many cases.<br><br>

            Life style modification is one of alternate strategy to address the problem of chronic diseases. Diet and excersie are much simpler way to control non communicable diseases.Health care resources can be optimized with less economic burden to society.
            .<br><br>

            Life style modification involves altering long term habits typically of eating, physical activity (
            exercise) avoidance of smoking and limiting alcohol usage.<br><br>

            Life style modification can be used to treat a range of diseases which include Metabolic syndrome or Insulin
            Resistance disorders.<br><br>
            Over weight and Obesity.<br>
            Diabetes.<br>
            Heart Diseases<br>
            High BP<br>
            Epilepsy.<br>
            Arthritis.<br>
            PCOD.<br>
            Thyroid disorders.<br>
            Fatty liver.<br>
            Skin allergies and psoriasis.<br>
            Acne and pimples<br>
            Bronchial Asthma<br>
            Adjuvant therapy to cancer of Breast colon prostate etc<br>
            Mental disorders <br>
            Alzheimer's dementia<br>
            Parkinsonism<br>
            Bowel disorders<br>
            IBM<br>
            Leaky gut syndrome<br> 
            Gout<br>


            <br>
            And many other diseases related to Metabolic syndrome.<br><br>

            For effective management we need to identify individual problems by proper adequate history, physical examination
            and certain laboratory tests.<br><br>

            Based on the results we can customise the treatment protocols.<br><br>

            Efficient dietary and physical activity management requires periodical follow up<br><br>
